HTML entities are special codes used to display characters that have a specific meaning or reserved use in HTML, preventing them from being interpreted as code. They start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;).

Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

&amp; - Represents the ampersand character (&). It is used to display an ampersand without HTML interpreting it as the beginning of an entity.

&lt; - Represents the less-than sign (<). It is used to display the less-than symbol without HTML interpreting it as the opening of an HTML tag.

&gt; - Represents the greater-than sign (>). It is used to display the greater-than symbol without HTML interpreting it as the closing of an HTML tag.

&quot; - Represents the double quotation mark ("). It is used to display double quotes without HTML interpreting them as the beginning or end of an attribute value.

&nbsp; - Represents a non-breaking space. It is used to add a space that prevents line breaks in text, useful for maintaining spacing between words or elements that should not be separated.

HTML entities are crucial for displaying special characters or symbols correctly within web pages, ensuring that they render properly without conflicting with the HTML structure or interpretation.
