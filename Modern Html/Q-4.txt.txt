
Certainly! Here are three ways to improve the accessibility of HTML:

Semantic HTML: Use semantic elements (such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <footer>) to structure the content logically. This assists screen readers and other assistive technologies in understanding the purpose and organization of the content, making it more accessible to users with disabilities.

Alt Text for Images: Include descriptive alternative text (alt attribute) for images. This provides meaningful descriptions for users who rely on screen readers, allowing them to understand the content or context conveyed by the images.

Keyboard Accessibility: Ensure that all interactive elements, including links, buttons, and form fields, can be easily accessed and navigated using only the keyboard. This benefits users who have motor disabilities and cannot use a mouse, allowing them to interact with the website effectively.
